# Abstractive Text Summarization Transformer Model

## Overview
This project implements an abstractive text summarization model using transformer architecture. Abstractive text summarization aims to generate a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document by understanding and rephrasing the content, rather than just extracting key sentences.

## Features
- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models for text summarization.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates summaries that are not just copied from the text but are newly constructed sentences.
- **Customizable and Scalable**: Easy to adapt and fine-tune for different datasets and applications.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Can be extended to support various languages with appropriate training data.

## Usage
Prepare Data: Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format.
Train Model: Train the transformer model using your dataset.
Generate Summaries: Use the trained model to generate summaries for new text documents.

## Example
from model import Summarizer

# Initialize the summarizer
summarizer = Summarizer()

# Load pre-trained model or train a new one
summarizer.load_model('path/to/model')

# Summarize text
text = "Your long text document here..."
summary = summarizer.summarize(text)

print("Summary:", summary)
